# Railway Server Path Resolution Fix

## Problem
Railway deployment was failing with "No suitable server file found" even though server files existed. The start.js script was using relative paths that didn't resolve correctly in Railway's container environment.

## Root Cause
- Railway container working directory structure differs from local development
- Relative paths like `./server/railway-production.js` failed to resolve
- Import failures caused restart loops without proper error handling

## Fix Applied

### 1. Enhanced start.js with Absolute Paths
**Before:**
```javascript
const serverOptions = [
  './server/railway-production.js',  // Relative path - failed
  './server/production.js',          
  './dist/index.js'                  
];
```

**After:**
```javascript
const serverOptions = [
  path.join(currentDir, 'server', 'railway-production.js'),  // Absolute path
  path.join(currentDir, 'server', 'production.js'),
  path.join(currentDir, 'server', 'railway-fallback.js'),   // New fallback
  path.join(currentDir, 'dist', 'index.js')
];
```

### 2. Added Comprehensive Debugging
- **Directory Logging**: Shows current working directory
- **File Existence Checks**: Verifies each server file before import
- **Directory Listing**: Shows available files if all imports fail
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: Full stack traces for import failures

### 3. Created Fallback Server (railway-fallback.js)
**Purpose**: Minimal server with basic functionality if complex imports fail
**Features:**
- Simple Express setup with minimal dependencies
- Static file serving for React frontend
- Health check endpoint
- Graceful shutdown handling
- SPA catch-all routing

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- **Async/Await**: Proper async handling for server imports
- **Graceful Degradation**: Tries multiple servers in order
- **Exit Strategy**: Clean process termination if all options fail
- **Debugging Output**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Expected Results
After pushing to Railway:
- ✅ Absolute paths resolve correctly in container environment
- ✅ Debugging output shows file discovery process
- ✅ Fallback server ensures deployment never fails completely
- ✅ Clean server startup without restart loops
- ✅ All Coffee Pro features working with full server
- ✅ Basic functionality guaranteed with fallback server

This fix ensures Railway deployment succeeds regardless of container path structure while maintaining full Coffee Pro functionality.
