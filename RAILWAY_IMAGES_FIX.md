# Railway Images Not Loading Fix

## Problem
Images are not loading on Railway deployment. The website shows placeholder alt text instead of actual images from the `attached_assets` folder.

## Root Cause
Railway's build process doesn't automatically copy the `attached_assets` folder to the static file serving location. The images exist in the source code but aren't accessible to the web server.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated Build Process (railway.json)
```bash
npm run build && npm run db:push && cp -r attached_assets dist/public/
```
This copies the `attached_assets` folder into the build directory where static files are served.

### 2. Enhanced Static File Serving (server/railway-production.js)
- Added multiple asset path checking
- Serves assets from both `/attached_assets` and `/assets` routes
- Provides detailed logging for debugging asset locations

### 3. Asset Path Resolution
The server now checks these locations for images:
1. `/app/attached_assets` (source location)
2. `/app/dist/public/attached_assets` (copied during build)
3. `/app/server/../attached_assets` (relative path)

## Expected Results
After pushing these changes to Railway:
- Build process will copy all images to the static serving directory
- Images will be accessible at both `/attached_assets/image.jpg` and `/assets/image.jpg`
- All Coffee Pro photos will display correctly on the website

## Troubleshooting
If images still don't load:
1. Check Railway build logs for "No attached_assets to copy" message
2. Verify attached_assets folder exists in your GitHub repository
3. Check server logs for "Serving assets from" message
4. Ensure .gitignore doesn't exclude attached_assets folder

The enhanced asset serving should resolve all image loading issues on Railway deployment.
