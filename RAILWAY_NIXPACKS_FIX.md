# Railway Nixpacks Configuration Fixed

## Problem Resolved
The nixpacks.toml file had an invalid `providers` configuration that caused the build to fail.

## Fix Applied
- Removed invalid `[providers.node]` section
- Simplified nixpacks.toml to basic build commands
- Removed database migration from build phase (will be done manually)

## Current Configuration

### nixpacks.toml
```toml
[phases.build]
cmds = [
  "npm install --no-cache --prefer-offline",
  "npm run build"
]

[phases.start]
cmd = "npm start"

[variables]
NODE_ENV = "production"
NPM_CONFIG_CACHE = "/tmp/.npm"
```

### railway.json
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "numReplicas": 1,
    "sleepApplication": false,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE"
  }
}
```

## Deployment Process

1. **Push Changes to GitHub**
   - Commit the fixed nixpacks.toml
   - Railway will auto-redeploy

2. **Build Process**
   - Install dependencies without cache issues
   - Build the Coffee Pro application
   - Start the server

3. **Manual Database Setup**
   After successful deployment:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

## Environment Variables Required
Set these in Railway dashboard:
```
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=a93f9205657eee8e31cfaca6bf94421e22983d52d29e442c645a6146d9de1ed5
ADMIN_PASSWORD=Coffeeproegypt
DATABASE_URL=(auto-provided by PostgreSQL service)
```

## Expected Results
- ✅ Nixpacks build completes successfully
- ✅ No more configuration parsing errors
- ✅ Coffee Pro app deploys and runs
- ✅ Database migration done manually after deployment

The nixpacks configuration is now valid and should deploy without errors.
