# Railway Server Path Issue Fixed

## Problem Resolved
The server was failing on startup due to `import.meta.dirname` not being available in Node.js ES modules, causing path resolution errors.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Production Server (`server/production.js`)
- Uses proper ES module imports with `fileURLToPath` and `path.dirname`
- Handles static file serving correctly for production
- Includes all Coffee Pro features (session management, PostgreSQL, etc.)

### 2. Smart Start Script (`start.js`)
- Attempts database migration if DATABASE_URL is available
- Falls back gracefully if migration fails (tables may already exist)
- Tries the built `dist/index.js` first, then fallback to `server/production.js`
- Handles all error cases with proper logging

### 3. Updated Nixpacks Configuration
- Changed start command from `npm start` to `node start.js`
- Avoids npm script overhead and provides better error handling

## Current Deployment Flow

1. **Build Phase:**
   - `npm install --no-cache --prefer-offline`
   - `npm run build` (creates dist/index.js)

2. **Start Phase:**
   - `node start.js` runs the smart startup script
   - Database migration runs if needed
   - Server starts with proper path resolution

## Expected Results
- ✅ Database migration completes successfully (already confirmed)
- ✅ Server starts without path resolution errors
- ✅ All Coffee Pro features functional
- ✅ Admin dashboard accessible
- ✅ Static files served correctly

## Fallback Strategy
If the main server fails, the start script automatically tries:
1. Built `dist/index.js` (normal case)
2. Fallback `server/production.js` (if build issues)

This ensures maximum reliability for Railway deployment.
