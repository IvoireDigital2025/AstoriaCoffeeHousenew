# Railway Database Connection Fix

## Problem
Railway deployment is failing with database connection error:
```
connect ECONNREFUSED fd12:924c:af4:0:a000:3d:1766:37d8:443
```

This indicates the database connection is being refused, likely due to:
1. Incorrect DATABASE_URL format for Railway's PostgreSQL
2. Missing SSL/connection configuration
3. Neon serverless configuration issues

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated Database Configuration (server/db.ts)
- Added Railway-specific Neon configuration
- Enabled secure WebSocket connections
- Disabled pipeline connect for stability
- Added connection timeout and pooling settings

### 2. Enhanced Session Store (server/railway-production.js)
- Added error logging for session store issues
- Better connection handling for Railway environment

## Required Environment Variable

Make sure the DATABASE_URL in Railway is correctly formatted. Railway provides this automatically when you link a PostgreSQL service.

The format should be:
```
postgresql://username:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require
```

## Alternative Solution

If the issue persists, Railway might be using a different database provider. Check:

1. Go to Railway project dashboard
2. Check if PostgreSQL service is properly linked
3. Verify DATABASE_URL is automatically populated
4. Consider switching to Railway's built-in PostgreSQL instead of external Neon

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. Verify DATABASE_URL exists in Railway Variables
2. Check Railway PostgreSQL service status
3. Ensure the database service is in the same project
4. Try redeploying after linking database service properly

The enhanced configuration should resolve most Railway database connection issues.
